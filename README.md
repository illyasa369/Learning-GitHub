# My First Repo
## This repo will be used to learn GitHub
This repo will include different experiments of pushing, pulling, branching, merging and many more.


Updates:

Seperate branches will be made for each machine I use.

Will no longer leave inactive branches open, branches will be merged and closed once they are no longer required.
